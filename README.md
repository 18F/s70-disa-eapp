# Schedule 70 RFQ: National Background Investigation System (NBIS), eApp

## Background
eApp serves as the applicant-facing system that provides security questionnaires for the Defense Information System Agency (DISA) National Background Investigative System (NBIS) platform.

NBIS is responsible for creating a new platform that would replace eQIP and other existing OPM systems. GSA/18F has worked closely with OPM and NBIS to replace the applicant-facing functionality of eQIP by testing and deploying a system called eApp. See the current [public repository](https://github.com/18F/e-QIP-prototype) to learn more about the project’s history, the product’s users, and the previously completed modules.

## What we're looking for:
This task order seeks to secure a contractor that will assist the NBIS and GSA 18F team in modifying the [current codebase](https://github.com/18F/e-QIP-prototype) to increase functionality that:


* Facilitates the dynamic creation of security questionnaire forms

* Improves validation rules for applicant interactions and agency flags

* Enables communication between agency security personnel and applicants

* Employs configuration to build new form types and validation rules in addition to integrating existing standard forms (including but not limited to NBIB INV-15 Section 5.0)

The primary goals are to enhance eApp to support the full suite of functionality required for the end-user application process. Particular characteristics of this work include: maintaining user-centric design, enhancing security and privacy, adding integration points with related systems, and adding support for operational, maintenance, and sustainment activities.
