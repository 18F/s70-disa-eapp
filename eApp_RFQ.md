<br>
<br>

## 2.1 PURPOSE 
This Statement of Objectives (SOO) describes the goals that GSA expects to achieve with
regards to expanding eApp to replace applicant-facing eQIP functionality and introduce new
capabilities in the background investigation process. This task order seeks to secure a contractor
to assist the NBIS and GSA team in modifying the current codebase to increase functionality
that:

* Facilitates the dynamic creation of security questionnaire forms

* Improves validation rules for applicant interactions and agency flags

* Enables communication between agency security personnel and applicants

* Employs configuration to build new form types and validation rules in addition to integrating
existing standard forms (including but not limited to [<span class="underline">NBIB INV-15 Section 5.0)</span>](https://nbib.opm.gov/hr-security-personnel/requesting-opm-personnel-investigations/requesting-the-investigation/#5.1)

The primary goals are to enhance eApp to support the full suite of functionality required for the
end-user application process. Particular characteristics of this work include: maintaining user-
centric design, enhancing security and privacy, adding integration points with related systems,
and adding support for operational, maintenance, and sustainment activities.
<br>
<br>

## 2.2 BACKGROUND

The national security of the United States depends upon a trusted
workforce. The task before the government, to assess someone’s
suitability for federal work, is a complex mandate that involves myriad
offices, processes, systems, and preferences. There are a multitude of
applications and systems that govern the process end-to-end involving
agency security offices, government-wide services, and investigative
service providers.

The complexity of the background investigation process led to processing
backlogs and security threats that have damaged the efficacy and
performance of our vetting process across the federal government. A
90-day commission gathered to address these concerns and develop a
[<span class="underline">strategy</span>](https://www.opm.gov/news/releases/2016/01/fact-sheet-modernizing-strengthening-the-security-effectiveness-of-federal-background-investigations/).

Amendments to Executive Order [<span class="underline">13467</span>](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2008/07/02/08-1409/reforming-processes-related-to-suitability-for-government-employment-fitness-for-contractor) and [<span class="underline">13488</span>](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/23/2017-01623/amending-the-civil-service-rules-executive-order-13488-and-executive-order-13467-to-modernize-the) - established the precedent to create two offices to address these issues:

  - National Background Investigation Bureau (NBIB) under the Office of
    Personnel Management (OPM) to manage investigation operations.

  - National Background Investigation System (NBIS) operated by the
    Department of Defense through the Defense Information Systems Agency
    (DISA) to manage the IT systems that applicants, employees, agency
    security personnel, contractors, and investigators use for their
    daily work.

The Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) is a
secure website currently managed by the United States Office of
Personnel Management (OPM) designed to automate the common security
questionnaires used to process federal background investigations. e-QIP
is operated by OPM National Background Investigations Bureau (NBIB). OPM
currently provides background investigations (BI) for federal employees
and contractors.

e-QIP functions as the primary system for requesting initial and renewal
investigations. Agency security personnel can request an investigation
and the system prompts applicants to complete the relevant online forms.
After applicants make edits and submit for final review the agency
releases the form’s data and associated administrative data to the
relevant Investigative Service Provider (ISP.)

The Electronic Application (eApp) is a new platform that maintains the existing role of applicant
facing eQIP while introducing new functionality including advanced form validation. It is the
user-facing front end for submission of security questionnaires for the Defense Information
System Agency (DISA) National Background Investigative Services (NBIS) common platform
for conducting security investigations shared by NBIB and the Department of Defense (DoD)
Defense Security Services (DSS).

NBIS is responsible for creating a new platform that would replace eQIP
and other existing OPM systems. GSA/18F has worked closely with OPM and
NBIS to replace the applicant-facing functionality of eQIP by testing
and deploying a system called eApp. See the current
[<span class="underline">public
repository</span>](https://github.com/18F/e-QIP-prototype) to learn more
about the project’s history, the product’s users, and the previously
completed modules.

eApp has built several improvements over the eQIP platform for several
reasons:

  - Conduct validation that would improve the quality of initial
    responses. Poor data quality, for example partial addresses, can
    cause ripple effects for the investigation process. Thousands of
    reviewers at agencies and ISPs spend every day manually reviewing
    PDFs for incomplete or poor data.

  - Usability research has informed every step of the development
    process and made a more intuitive flow through the questions.

  - Improved accessibility and user-friendly interaction

The current version of eApp was built to handle an SF-86 form that would
support the NBIS initial operating concept of processing Tier 3
background investigations.
<br>
<br>

## 2.3 OBJECTIVES

To fulfill the objectives for performance of this task order, the
Contractor must expand the platform through functionality and content
that meets the needs described in the epics in the following
subsections. Please note that, in subsequent sprints, we may refine
these objectives to ensure we’re continually meeting user needs. In
agreement with the product owner, we may modify, add, retract, or
re-prioritize the epics below to reflect additional research findings.
The COR will provide written notification of any epics that are deemed
unnecessary as a result of research.

The Contractor must build custom software to extend the
[<span class="underline">functionality of
eApp</span>](https://github.com/18F/e-QIP-prototype) using agile methods
that fulfill the following epics, or new user stories, as the client and
the contractor work together to incrementally develop the software.

Based on the above objectives, the Government expects the submission of
a Performance Work Statement that is structured around the following:

**Epics**

The contractor shall build or adapt the current eApp platform where:

  - Each type of NBIB investigation can be initiated for applicants to complete

  - New and existing form types, including but not limited to SF-85/P and OF-306, can be created and dynamically served to applicants based on configuration and rule sets

  - Forms are created, assigned, and tracked for each individual’s case

  - Applicants can correspond with agency personnel to complete form

  - Agency review and validation rules are flagged as applicants complete the form

  - Applicants can view, confirm, and/or edit data from prior applications when they return to renew their clearance

  - Form data including responses, validations triggered, and completion progress is logged and shared with other systems for case management purposes

  - The workflow is intuitive and friendly for expert and novice users, including: resetting accounts, replying to questions and understanding the other people and processes involved in getting their investigation resolved.

  - Users can easily navigate and complete eApp from the most common desktop and phones platforms as well as screen readers.

  - Permissions are configurable to allow only those needed to have access to sensitive data.

**Note:** User stories that may be included as part of this task order are
included as an attachment.

**Note:** Additional stories will result from user research, usability
tests, and feedback from real end-users once the system is in
production. New stories will be discussed as part of sprint planning and
backlog refinement. The Product Owner may also choose to close stories
before they are implemented.

    or potential OCI to the GSA’s CO in accordance with FAR Subpart 9.5.
    The nature of the OCI may involve the prime contractor,
    subcontractors of any tier, or teaming partners.

2)  The contractor is required to complete and sign an OCI. The
    contractor must represent either that (1) It is not aware of any
    facts which create any actual or potential OCI relating to the award
    of this contract, or (2) It has included information in its quote,
    providing all current information bearing on the existence of any
    actual or potential OCI and has included a mitigation plan in

    conflict can be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor
    shall submit a mitigation plan to the Government for review.

4)  In addition to the mitigation plan, the GSA’s CO may require further
    information from the contractor. The GSA’s CO will use all
    information submitted by the contractor, and any other relevant
    information known to GSA, to determine whether an award to the
    contractor may take place, and whether the mitigation plan
    adequately avoids, neutralizes, or mitigates the OCI.

5)  If any such conflict of interest is found to exist, the GSA’s CO may
    determine that the conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized,
    mitigated, or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the
    Government and the contractor may be found ineligible for award.
    Alternatively, the GSA’s CO may determine that it is otherwise in
    the best interest of the U.S. to contract with the contractor and
    include the appropriate provisions to avoid, neutralize, mitigate,
    or waive such conflict in the contract awarded

writing, before utilizing that work in any way in connection with the
order. If approved, all licenses shall be clearly set forth in a
conspicuous place when work is delivered to GSA.

If an open source license provides implementation guidance, the
contractor shall ensure compliance with that guidance. If implementation
guidance is not available, the contractor shall attach or include the
license within the work itself. Examples of this include code comments
at the beginning of a file or contained in a license file within a
software repository.

<br>
<br>

## 10.7 ORAL INTERVIEW

Each offeror will be provided the questions, via e-mail, approximately
60 minutes prior to their Oral Presentation. The Government is much more
interested in the informational content of the offeror’s answers rather
than the particular style or technique used in delivering the answers.

Schedule and Agenda:

|        Agenda Item        |     Time Allocated                       |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Government Provides Questions to Offeror | Approximately 60 Minutes Prior to Oral Presentation (via e-mail)|
| Introductions              | Approximately 5 Minutes |
| Offeror Orals               | 30 minutes maximum |
| Break for Offeror & Government Questions    | 5 Minutes Maximum |
| Government Follow-Up Q&A (if needed)             | 10 Minutes Maximum    |

No part of these oral presentations - for example, discussions and
negotiations - constitutes a procedure in FAR Part 15. For this reason,
the Government is not obligated to and does not intend to determine a
competitive range, conduct discussions, and request quote revisions.

Offerors will not be able to use or present slides, graphs, charts or
any other written presentation materials, including handouts.

#### Content
After introductions, the offeror will be given up to 30 minutes to
present. The Contracting Officer will strictly enforce this time limit
on all presentations. The entire session will be documented by the
Government.

The Offeror will respond to the Government provided questions. All
offerrors will be asked the same questions. The questions will focus on
the Key Personnel’s experience and skills with refactoring large
projects, leveraging open source libraries, employing human centered
design practices, and working within continuous deployment environments.

Upon completion, the Government may caucus to formulate any additional
clarification questions regarding the presentation The Government will
allocate 10 minutes that will serve to clarify any information that was
presented. If the Government has no follow-up questions with a
particular offeror, then this part of the session will not take place.

#### Location
Oral Presentations will take place via video chat, though audio may be
substituted as needed. The Government will coordinate and set up the
meeting space accordingly (providing dial-in information or links using
a tool such as Zoom or Appear.in).The offeror may **not** record or
transmit any of the Q\&A session.

#### Date and Time
The Government will schedule the date and time of the oral presentations
with each Offeror that progress to Phase 4 of the evaluation process.
The Government reserves the right to reschedule any Offeror’s oral
presentations date at the discretion of the contracting officer.

#### Participants
Participation in the oral presentations shall include the proposed Key
Personnel. The Government is most interested in hearing from staff who
will have a direct role in completing the task. Content presented by any
non-Key Personnel will not be evaluated. The Offeror will be considered
non-responsive and excluded from further consideration if the Key
Personnel do not participate. Offerors may include as many participants
as are necessary. Offerors should note that the Government will be
asking technical questions during the oral presentation, so
non-technical personnel may not need to attend. After the presentations,
Offerors must email the meeting organizers the names of everyone who
attended.

#### Videotaping and/or Voice Recording
The Government may elect to videotape and/or voice record the oral
presentation session at its discretion and is its exclusive right and
property. The Government will not provide a copy of the videotape or
recordings to the contractor, and the contractor is prohibited from
making its own recording (in any way or by any method) of the oral
presentation session. Contractors agree to this when they participate in
this RFQ.
<br>
<br>

Offerors are requested to submit questions on the
[<span class="underline">GitHub
repository</span>](https://github.com/18F/s70-disa-eapp) provided by the
government. Questions must follow the template provided, named:

<br>
<br>

## 11.1 METHOD OF AWARD

The Government anticipates awarding a TO to the offeror whose quote is
the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors
considered. A price evaluation will only be done for offerors with a
technical quote receiving an overall technical rating of ACCEPTABLE or
higher. All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are
significantly more important than price. Award may be made to the
offeror whose quote is determined be the best value for the Government.

Accordingly, the Government reserves the right to do any or all of the
following:

1.  Award on initial quotes, without discussion.

2.  The Government reserves the right to seek a price reduction from any
    or all offerors in accordance with FAR 8.405-4.

3.  Have communications; ask clarifying questions, request corrections
    relative to minor errors in the price quote, or request price
    substantiating documentation to facilitate the Government’s final
    evaluation of price quotes with one or some offerors. These
    communications, clarifications, or requests for corrections or
    substantiating documentation will not materially change the
    offeror’s quote in terms of conformance to RFQ requirements,
    constitute discussions such as the removal of an unacceptable
    assumption, or materially change pricing.

Quotes shall set forth full, accurate, and complete information as
required by this solicitation package (including Attachments). The
penalty for making false statements in quotes is prescribed in 18 U.S.C.
1001.
<br>
<br>

## 11.2 EXPLANATION FOR BASIS OF AWARD

This award will be made under FAR 8.4; formal debriefings will not be
conducted. In accordance with 8.405-2(d), a brief explanation of the
basis for the award decision shall be provided upon request.
<br>
<br>

## 11.3 PRICE QUOTE EVALUATION

The offeror’s price quote (TABs D & E) will be evaluated to assess for
price reasonableness. The Government will assess the level of effort and
the mix of labor proposed. Proposed hourly rates will be compared to the
corresponding hourly rates on the underlying GSA Schedule contract.
Price reductions will be sought as appropriate in accordance with FAR
8.405-4.

Prices that are excessively high or low (without sufficient
justification) may be considered unreasonable and may receive no further
consideration.

The Government will reject any proposal that includes any assumptions,
conditions or exception.

The six-month extension period, authorized by FAR clause 52.217-8, will
not be included in the total evaluated price; however, it will be
evaluated to ensure that the option is available for the unilateral
exercise of the Government should an extension become necessary. The
offeror shall not propose a price for the six-month extension.
<br>
<br>


## 11.4 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST

Tab A will be evaluated to assess whether or not an actual or potential
OCI exists as defined by FAR Part 9.5. If an actual or potential OCI is
identified that cannot be mitigated, avoided, or resolved in accordance
with FAR Part 9.5, that offeror may be ineligible for award.
<br>
<br>


## 11.5 CONTRACT REGISTRATION

Any quote received from a contractor not registered in ITSS (Tab B) will
be rejected and will be ineligible for award.
<br>
<br>

## 11.6 PASS/FAIL ELEMENTS

The Government will evaluate the following pass/fail elements. **A
failure on the Pass/Fail criteria will make the quote ineligible for
award, with no further evaluation of the technical and price quote
conducted by the Government.**

The following will be evaluated on a Pass/Fail basis:

### 11.6.1 CORPORATE EXPERIENCE

The Government will reject any quote that does not include code
repositories that meet 4 of the 9 conditions.

### 11.6.2 508 COMPLIANCE STATEMENT

The Government will reject any quote that does not provide a Section 508
Compliance Statement.
<br>
<br>


## 11.7 TECHNICAL QUOTE EVALUATION 

The technical quote evaluation factors are listed in descending order of
importance. All four technical factors combined are significantly more
important than price. The Government will combine the results of the
written and oral presentations to arrive at a rating for the technical
evaluation factors as a whole.

The Government will evaluate offerors in phases and progressively reduce
the number being considered for task order award. The purpose of this
procedure is to reduce the time and cost of source selection, both for
the Government and for the competing offerors. To be considered for
award, offerors must successfully pass through each phase. Offerors will
be notified within 5 business days if their quote does not successfully
pass through any phase. Procedures will be executed as follows:

Phase 1. Evaluate the acceptability of each offer in accordance with the
Pass/Fail criteria in the RFQ. The Government will eliminate from
further consideration any offerors that submitted quotes that failed.

Phase 2. Evaluate Key Personnel and Staffing Plan of the remaining
offerors and eliminate any that do not receive an Acceptable rating or
higher on each factor and are not sufficiently competitive to be
selected for task order award.

Phase 3. Evaluate Usability Research Approach and PWS of the remaining
offerors and eliminate any that do not receive an Acceptable rating or
higher on each factor and are not sufficiently competitive to be
selected for task order award.

Phase 4. Once the Government has reduced the number of offerors, oral
interview will be scheduled with the remaining offerors. The Government
will make the best value decision by comparing these offerors on the
basis of Key Personnel, Staffing Plan, Usability Research Approach, PWS,
and price and make award without discussions.

The decision to eliminate any offeror through this procedure will not
constitute the establishment of a competitive range, as described in FAR
15.306\[c\], and it will not obligate the Government to conduct
discussions or to solicit or entertain proposal revisions.

Desired Quote Qualities utilized to conduct the evaluation are defined
as follows:

a. Beneficial – Producing good or helpful results or effects. Providing
benefits.

b. Relevant – Specific to these requirements. Directly connected with
the Government’s requirements, conditions, standards, and processes.

c. Comprehensive – Encompasses all aspects of the approach. Complete.

d. Efficient – Capable of producing results without waste of materials,
time, or effort.
<br>
<br>

## 11.8 EVALUATION FACTORS

### 11.8.1 FACTOR 1- KEY PERSONNEL

The offeror’s Key Personnel will be evaluated based on:

1.  The degree of relevance of the stated qualifications, experience and
    roles of each Key Personnel to meet the stated objectives in Section
    2.

2.  The degree to which the Key Personnel meet or exceed the minimum
    qualifications and experience in Section 6.1.

### 11.8.2 FACTOR 2 - STAFFING PLAN

The offeror’s Staffing Plan will be evaluated based on:

1.  The degree of relevancy and efficiency of the staffing rationale,
    including the level of effort and labor mix, and how the proposed
    staffing solution will accomplish the Government’s objectives and
